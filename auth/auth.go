// Package auth defines a structured way of authorizing access to a
// service.
//
// It relies on a third party (the identity service) to authenticate
// users and define group membership.
//
// When a user has authenticated themselves, they are allowed to obtain
// short-term capabilities that can be passed around so that third
// parties can act on their behalf.
//
// Users and groups and ACLs and entities
//
// A user represents some authenticated user. The nature of that
// authentication is not part of the scope of this package, but at the
// least each user has an id (the same each time a given user connects)
// and a domain that defines the name space within which the id lives.
//
// A group represents some collection of users. It is possible to find
// out whether a user is a member of a group, but not necessarily to
// find out all users that are part of the group. Groups live in the
// same name space as users - in general every user is a group with at
// least one member: itself.
//
// An ACL defines an access control list - a set of users and groups,
// any one of whom may access something. A user will be allowed to
// access something protected by an ACL if the user is a member of any
// of the members of the ACL.
//
// An entity holds something in a service that is subject to
// authorization control. Every entity has a name that's defines it -
// every service will define its own set of entities. No service-defined
// entity should start with the prefixes "login" or "multi-" - these are
// reserved for internal use only.
//
// Operations and authorization and capabilities
//
// An operation defines some requested action on an entity. For example,
// if file system server defines an entity for every file in the
// server, an operation to read a file might look like:
//
//     Op{
//		Entity: "/foo",
//		Action: "write",
//	}
//
// The exact set of entities and actions is up to the caller, but should
// be kept stable over time because authorization tokens will contain
// these names.
//
// To authorize some request on behalf of a remote user, first find out
// what operations that request needs to perform. For example, if the
// user tries to delete a file, the entity might be the path to the
// file's directory and the action might be "write". It may often be
// possible to determine the operations required by a request without
// reference to anything external, when the request itself contains all
// the necessary information.
//
// The primary way of authorizing is by authentication. If a client can
// prove their identity, then Authorize can check whether they're a
// member of an ACL. If the client can't prove their identity, Authorize
// will return a macaroon that can be used to do so. This is known as an
// "authentication" macaroon and should not in general be passed to
// third parties because it can be used to perform any operation that
// the user is alowed.
//
// If a user is allowed to perform a set of operations, that user may
// also request a "capability" macaroon that can be used to perform
// those operations for a limited period of time. This differs from the
// authentication macaroon in that it authorizes the operations
// implicitly without the need for authentication, so can be passed to
// third parties to act on the user's behalf.
//
// Note if operations are derived from a request, the scope of the
// capability for the request might allow more than exactly that request
// - for example, if the user requested to write the string "bar" to the
// file /foo, the resulting capability might allow any write to that
// file. It is up to the service to define and document the granularity
// of operations.
//
// Capabilities may be combined for authorization, so a request that
// involves several operations may be authorized by a set of
// capabilities that authorize all the operations between them, even
// though no single one is sufficient. Note that because a capability
// may be created for any set of operations that can be authorized, this
// means we can combine several capabilities into a single capability
// with the the capabilities of all.
//
// Third party caveats
//
// Sometimes just a set of operations is not sufficient to determine
// whether the user should be granted access to an entity. For example,
// we might need the user to verify something about the entity with some
// third party.
//
// This is why there is a caveats argument to Authorize and Capability.
// If a third party caveat is provided in it, it will have been checked
// before authorization succeeds.
